Carrollton|Carrollton is a city in western Georgia, United States, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 24,388. The city is the county seat of Carroll County. When the CVB and Carrollton Main Street co-produced a walking tour brochure about Carrollton’s historic city cemetery a few years ago, we had no idea just how popular it would be. Now, three years and several hundred brochures later, the cemetery tour is one of our community’s most popular heritage tourism experiences. Now, a brand new free mobile app promises to grow that popularity while offering a customized guided tour experience. The Carrollton Area CVB partnered with our mobile app designers, Populace, Inc., to produce the “Historic Carrollton City Cemetery Tour,” app, available under that name at the App Store for both Apple and Android. The app contains great elements you can’t get in the brochure like an interactive map, more pictures, narration and, best of all, it’s updateable. There will be things added to the app as we go.||Carrollton|GA||City|testcontributor|achildr1
